Description: Functions for identification and transportation of causal effects.  Provides a conditional causal effect identification algorithm (IDC) by Ilya Shpitser and Judea Pearl, an algorithm for transportability from multiple domains with limited experiments by Elias Bareinboim and Judea Pearl and a selection bias recovery algorithm by Elias Bareinboim and Jin Tian.  All of the previously mentioned algorithms are based on a causal effect identification algorithm by Jin Tian.
